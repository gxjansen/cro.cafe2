# Career Timeline Component - Implementation Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Component Updates (CareerTimeline.astro)

#### Props Interface
```typescript
export interface Props {
  experiences: string;          // JSON string of LinkedInExperience[]
  firstEpisodeDate: string;    // ISO date of first podcast appearance
  guestName: string;           // For accessibility
}
```

#### Key Features Implemented:
- **Conditional Rendering**: Component returns null if no experiences exist
- **Smart Date Filtering**: Only shows jobs from first episode appearance onwards
- **Reverse Chronological Order**: Most recent job appears first (left/top)
- **Responsive Design**: Horizontal layout on desktop, vertical on mobile
- **Timeline Arrow**: Added directional arrow pointing from past to present
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels for screen readers

### 2. Parent Component Updates

Updated both guest detail pages:
- `/src/pages/guests/[slug].astro`
- `/src/pages/[lang]/guests/[slug].astro`

Replaced ThenNowCard with CareerTimeline component, passing required props:
- `experiences`: JSON stringified LinkedIn experiences
- `firstEpisodeDate`: Date of guest's first episode appearance
- `guestName`: Guest name for accessibility

### 3. Visual Improvements

- **Desktop**: Horizontal timeline with flex-direction: row-reverse
- **Mobile**: Vertical timeline with flex-direction: column-reverse
- **Arrow**: SVG arrow aligned with timeline track
- **Removed**: Episode marker and "Career Progression" label

## Testing Notes

The component now:
1. Only renders when experiences data exists
2. Filters experiences to show career progression since first podcast appearance
3. Displays jobs in reverse chronological order (newest first)
4. Has proper arrow alignment on the timeline
5. Works responsively on mobile and desktop
6. Includes proper ARIA labels for accessibility
