My team and I have been listening to the podcast and love that we found somebody who talks to a subject near and dear to all our hearts. We have a weekly book club meeting and a monthly growth event.  I assign additional training content like the CRO.CAFE podcast out to my org that is discussed as part of those meetings as well.
