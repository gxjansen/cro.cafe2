linkedin_bio: "“Eden got to the heart of our messaging and captured it in clear and compelling language. And then helped us create a fresh, new website that’s fully aligned with the company’s business objectives. It was a real pleasure working with her.”\n\n- Howard Silverman, Head of Marketing @CyberProof, a UST company\n\n---\n\nYour tech’s got the power to save your audience's world 🦸‍♀️\n\nBut if your TA:\n\n❌ Doesn't know you exist\n❌ Doesn't know why they should care\n❌ Doesn't know how or why you're different from those other guys on the same magic quadrant\n\n– then winning them as customers is going to be frankly, almost impossible.\n\nAt CAPE.Agency, my (tiny but mighty) team and I use conversion messaging (conversion copywriting + strategic messaging) to wrap your tech up in a clear and powerful verbal cape.\n\nSo your audience instantly recognizes:\n\n● What your tech does\n● Who it’s for\n● Why it’s awesome\n\nWe then apply this new messaging to your website, ads, landing pages, emails, and more to earn prospects' attention, and convert that attention quickly – and profitably – into sign-ups, booked demos, and closed/won deals.\n\nAnd the results? Well, they're super 💥\n\n→ Home page messaging that fixed positioning and doubled sign-ups for an early-stage PLG SaaS.\n\n→ 30% lift in conversions with 95% statistical confidence for a B2B SaaS \"book a demo\" page.\n\n→ A B2B SaaS home page that doubled visitors' time on page, doubled time on page, and cut the bounce rate from 51.5% to 35.6%.\n\n---\n\n\"It was really incredible to work with Eden. As part of our rebrand we had new messaging and positioning ready to go, but needed help translating that into fresh copy to support our PPC ads and other assets. And Eden really delivered! The copy was clear and crisp, was presented well, and was received well by the team.\"\n\n- Kate Gleeson, Head of Brand @Supermetrics\n\n---\n\n“Your initial prototype captured our needs very well and provided suggestions that fit perfectly into our existing frameworks and that we’d never considered. You were a pleasure to work with through multiple rounds of edits, and everyone on the team was pleased to have you onboard for the duration of the project!\"\n\n- Kate Gregorio, Former Manager Web UX Content @GoTo\n\n---\n\nSo if your software is ready to conquer the world then send me a DM to book a 20-min intro call today."
