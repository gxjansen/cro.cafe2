linkedin_bio: "I help organisations lead, collaborate, and thrive remotely.\n\nWith over 20 years of experience in distributed work, I’ve trained hundreds of teams, spoken at global conferences, and advised startups to UN agencies on how to make remote-first actually work. From virtual leadership to hybrid team design, I equip leaders with the mindsets and tools they need to succeed in a flexible world.\n\nI’m the author of Work Together Anywhere, a handbook used by teams around the world. I’ve also hosted a podcast on remote work best practices and delivered a TEDx talk on the power of working from anywhere. As Head of Remote at Management 3.0, I helped shape the culture and infrastructure of a fully distributed organisation.\n\nThrough my company, Collaboration Superpowers, I lead a global network of licensed facilitators delivering workshops on hybrid collaboration, async communication, and online facilitation.\n\nI’ve served on the EU/US Transatlantic Expert Group on the Future of Work and continue to speak and consult on how to create inclusive, high-trust remote environments that get results.\n\n Want to explore how we can work together?\n Learn more in my Personal User Manual: https://lisettesutherland.com/personal-user-manual-of-lisette-sutherland/"
