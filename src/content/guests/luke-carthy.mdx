linkedin_bio: "\"As a pure play SEO; this year I've failed... Year-on-year traffic for a client was fairly flat. However, online sales had increased 175% in the same period.\"\n\neCommerce growth is about so much more than just increasing visibility and traffic. \n\nAnother client increased their sales by Â£30,000 a week after I'd identified and fixed a number of key UX/CX bottlenecks. Again, no traffic change.\n\nTo be clear, increasing traffic via SEO, PPC etc is absolutely part of eCommerce growth, essential in fact, its what I do, but it's rarely the first step to take.\n\nTrue, sustainable ecommerce growth is about identifying a website's underlying issues and opportunities first, proactively addressing those and only then, growing traffic. \n\nConsultant - I consult for eCommerce businesses, from cultivating strategic ideas through to comprehensive audits and leading thorough transformation. \n\nSpeaker - I speak at a range of conferences, meetups and events spanning digital marketing, eCommerce and SEO. Recent appearances include MozCon, SearchLove, and BrightonSEO.\n\nBlogger - eCommerce is an ever-evolving industry. Whether you're referring to tech stack or customer expectation the same remains true. I share insights and dissect real-world case studies on my blog (lukecarthy.com) \n\nFor the last 12 years, I've specialised in delivering sales, customer and conversion growth for ecommerce businesses leveraging my core disciplines in technical SEO, CRO and eCommerce strategy."
