linkedin_bio: "Update: I’ve decided to look for a new CRO role, away from agency life. \n\nI enjoy working with clients, but have realized I prefer being focused on just one client at a time, so I want to find a great business to work for full-time! \n\nI'm looking for exciting CRO roles, ideally for ambitious ecommerce businesses in London. I have the most experience in apparel, jewellery and luxury goods, but am open to other types of ecom business or SaaS. Web analytics roles are also of interest to me if they include CRO. And no agency roles please.\n\nHiring for any of these types of CRO roles or heard of any interesting opportunities? Please let me know.\n\nI have helped ecommerce businesses increase their conversion rates and revenue with CRO audits, conversion research and A/B testing. And I've been doing this for 15 years for brands like UnboundMerino.com and JosephJoseph.com\n\n I focus on gaining conversion research insights from my expert CRO review, customer and visitor surveys, and user testing to maximize your website conversion rates and revenue - not just A/B testing that experts or agencies rely on. \n\n You get CRO help from just me, a seasoned CRO expert with 15 years experience. Not from a potential team of rookies or outsourced help like you may get with agencies.\n\nRecent examples of CRO success for clients: \n 44% increase in conversion rate for UnboundMerino.com, and $216K in annualized revenue.\n 19% increase in conversion rate for JosephJoseph.com, and £260K in annualized revenue. \n 66% increase in conversion rate for an online mattress retailer, and $2.6M in annualized revenue.\n\nFind out more about my CRO services and get a free CRO teardown for any page on your website. \nhttps://www.rich-page.com/conversion-rate-optimization-services/\n\nI’m also the author of two popular books about CRO, ‘Website Optimization: An Hour a Day’ and ‘Landing Page Optimization’ 2nd edition with Tim Ash.\n\nSpecialities: CRO, web analytics, A/B testing, conversion research, user testing, Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, Adobe Target, Optimizely, VWO, Google Optimize, Hotjar, UserTesting.com, Google Data Studio, Google Ads"
