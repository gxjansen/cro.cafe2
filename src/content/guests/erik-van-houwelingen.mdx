linkedin_bio: "Data driven optimization, that's me in a nutshell.\nI've always worked with (web) data. And when you combine that with a clear customer focus, the cool thing is that you can very easily use it to make a HUGE impact on your customer happiness (and your sales...).\n\nI have about 15 years of experience in competitive retail environments, both at a large pure player and an omnichannel retailer. 5 of those years a big part of my job has been to get the most out of a team of several specialists. I really enjoy building a team, developing and challenging people, while working towards a bigger picture with other (ecommerce and non-ecommerce) managers. \n\nTo do this I think it's vital to always keep up to date with my fields of expertise or learn more about the new ones I come across. My mother tongue still is CRO and web analytics. Lost count over the years, but I think I ran over 500 experiments myself or with the team. I'm fluent in SEO, UX, SEA, and content marketing. And over all the years I've learned to speak the language of e-mail, CRM, data science and everything related to e-commerce."
