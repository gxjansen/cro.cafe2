linkedin_bio: "For the past 20+ years, I’ve built and led Analytics organizations focused on optimizing enterprise websites, eCommerce platforms, web apps, cloud technologies, desktop software, and mobile products. Business Intelligence is the key to effective business strategy and happy customers, both online and offline.\n\nThe combination of my visual design talents, capacity for structuring and interpreting big data, and software engineering background has laid the groundwork for an exciting and fulfilling career in an industry that’s always changing and ever-relevant. \n\nAll of my experience, along with my passion for Real Estate and alternative investing, has culminated in the creation of Wealth Syndy - the first passive investing tool solely focused on the investor. Wealth Syndy is a tool designed to empower passive investors to evaluate real estate investments easier, track performance holistically, and build wealth smarter through syndications.\n\nSign up to stay up to date at http://wealthsyndy.com or reach out if you would like to talk investments!"
