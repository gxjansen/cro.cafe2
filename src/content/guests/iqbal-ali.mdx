linkedin_bio: "With over 20 years of expertise in UX design, development, data, and optimisation, I can help you improve the quality and velocity of your experiment programs. Whether providing training to existing teams or executing an experiment program myself, researching, ideating, developing experiments, and analysing experiments. \n\nMy approach at organisations with existing programs is to start with auditing existing processes, shadowing teams, assessing technical tooling and site architecture. I analyse data quality issues and implement solutions, leveraging Python to develop tools to automations to reduce friction points and improve processes.\n\nFor those seeking a comprehensive solution, I conduct site-wide audits encompassing site analytics, qualitative research, and more. I have also developed my own user review and text-mining application, utilizing AI to extract valuable insights from user feedback and reviews, thereby aiding in product improvement and experiment backlog development.\n\nI was previously the Head of Experimentation at Trainline, where I set up and led the experiment program. I've also helped build experiments and run programs at BBC Maestro, Simpson Millar, Eventbrite, and more.\n\nI'm the author of the \"CRO Tales\" comic series on LinkedIn; co-host of the \"Treachery of Data\" YouTube/podcast; and co-host of the Conversion World Roundtable, where we deep-dive into industry topics. \n\nI'm also a self-published comics creator and graphic novelist (see https://iqbala.com for details).\n\nAs an independent consultant, I offer my services to startups, medium-sized enterprises, and large corporations. With my end-to-end experience in experimentation, I'm ready to help."
