linkedin_bio: "I am an experienced experimentation practitioner. My specialty is designing and building the infrastructure and processes required to start and scale A/B testing to drive business growth.\n\nI combine industry experience in online experimentation and data science with an academic background in computing science and machine learning. For eight years, I was responsible for A/B testing at Booking.com, widely acknowledged leader in the field of online experimentation. I grew the Booking.com in-house experimentation team from four to thirty people, and became the first Director of Experimentation in the company.\n\nI help companies make A/B testing an integrated part of business processes. I advocate for accessibility of experimentation, helping people from any background (product owners, designers, developers, writers) to make the right decisions. My impact in the field of business experimentation was recognised in the Harvard Business Review story “Building a Culture of Experimentation” (March - April 2020 issue).\n\nI have co-authored multiple influential academic papers on the topic of online experimentation. I have presented at numerous conferences, including Growth Marketing Summit, CXL Live, and Google Catalyst Conference, SIGIR and KDD.\n\nCurrently I am employed as Director of Experimentation at Vistaprint. I am also available as a freelance consultant to help businesses grow their experimentation culture."

Online Controlled Experiments (OCEs), aka A/B tests, are becoming a standard operating procedure in software companies to address this challenge as they can detect small causal changes in user behavior due to product modifications (e.g. new features). However, like any data analysis method, OCEs are sensitive to trustworthiness and data quality issues which, if go unaddressed or unnoticed, may result in making wrong decisions. One of the most useful indicators of a variety of data quality issues is a Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM) ? the situation when the observed sample ratio in the experiment is different from the expected. Just like fever is a symptom for multiple types of illness, an SRM is a symptom for a variety of data quality issues. While a simple statistical check is used to detect an SRM, correctly identifying the root cause and preventing it from happening in the future is often extremely challenging and time consuming. Ignoring the SRM without knowing the root cause may result in a bad product modification appearing to be good and getting shipped to users, or vice versa. The goal of this paper is to make diagnosing, fixing, and preventing SRMs easier. Based on our experience of running OCEs in four different software companies in over 25 different products used by hundreds of millions of users worldwide, we have derived a taxonomy for different types of SRMs. We share examples, detection guidelines, and best practices for preventing SRMs of each type. We hope that the lessons and practical tips we describe in this paper will speed up SRM investigations and prevent some of them. Ultimately, this should lead to improved decision making based on trustworthy experiment analysis.\"}]}]},{\"title\":\"Mediation Analysis in Online Experiments at Booking.com: Disentangling Direct and Indirect Effects\",\"subtitle\":\"CodeCon Conference 2018 · Oct 29, 2018\",\"breakdown\":false,\"subComponents\":[{\"description\":[{\"type\":\"textComponent\",\"text\":\"Online experimentation is at the core of Booking.com's customer-centric product development. While randomised controlled trials are a powerful tool for estimating the overall effects of product changes on business metrics, they often fall short in explaining the mechanism of change. This becomes problematic when decision-making depends on being able to distinguish between the direct effect of a treatment on some outcome variable and its indirect effect via a mediator variable. In this paper, we demonstrate the need for mediation analyses in online experimentation, and use simulated data to show how these methods help identify and estimate direct causal effect. Failing to take into account all confounders can lead to biased estimates, so we include sensitivity analyses to help gauge the robustness of estimates to missing causal factors.\"}]}]}]"
