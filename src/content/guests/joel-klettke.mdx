linkedin_bio: "I help brands with their conversion and customer proof, from GTM strategy and conversion copywriting to building customer story flywheels.\n\nBefore this season... \n\nI built and ran a 7-figure business (Case Study Buddy) with an incredible partner and amazing team that served over 350 companies, including some of the largest brands on the planet (like HubSpot, Zoom, Shopify, and Loom.)\n\nThat experience taught me a lot about business, social proof, and myself.\n\nAnd before *that*, I consulted to brands like HubSpot, Scott's Cheap Flights (now: Going), Benevity, and more on conversion and positioning.\n\nI helped them dial in their messaging and drive more revenue by leading them through the entire process of research, analysis, strategy setting, creation, deployment, and refinement. \n\nUltimately, my work has directly contributed to tens (if not hundreds) of millions in added revenue.
