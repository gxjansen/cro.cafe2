linkedin_bio: "My career has been driven by a singular obsession: fundamentally changing the way the business world makes growth and innovation decisions. For nearly two decades, I've forged a unique path using data and experimentation to ignite digital innovation and elevate customer experience.\n\nWhile the term 'experimentation' has gained traction, I've observed a profound disconnect in its application. Too often, it's relegated to superficial A/B testing or seen as a tactical tweak, failing to deliver its true potential as a strategic driver of growth. This narrow focus leads to siloed learning, unquantifiable investment, and continued reliance on opinion and guesswork for critical business decisions.\n\nThis is why I champion Experimentation-Led Growth (ELG). At its core, ELG is about moving beyond mere 'optimisation' to build robust, evidence-driven operating systems for sustained business impact. It's about empowering organisations to de-risk ambitious innovation, accelerate learning velocity, and generate compounding commercial outcomes. My work focuses on integrating Growth Experimentation Systems & Engineering – connecting the strategic vision, the operational infrastructure, and the customer insights to ensure every investment drives tangible, measurable progress.\n\nMy unique blend of agency, client-side, and management consultancy experience at senior levels has equipped me with a holistic view of the digital landscape. From leading product analytics for Visa Checkout and building high-impact product discovery teams at Sky, to owning the P&L for front-end Digital Product at Boohoo Group, as well as scaling a digital experience consultancy from scratch, I've consistently applied an experimentation mindset to unlock significant commercial value.\n\nI partner with visionary leaders – VPs of Growth, Product Directors, Digital Directors, and C-suite executives – who are determined to move past the limitations of traditional approaches. If you're looking to transform how your teams learn, ship, and grow; if you're seeking to embed genuine evidence-based decision-making across your organisation; or if you want to unlock step-change velocity and impact from your digital investments, let's connect. I'm keen to share insights and explore how a Growth Experimentation approach can redefine your trajectory.\n\nContact me at jonny@speero.com or +44 777 909 6222 to find out how we can help you grow."
