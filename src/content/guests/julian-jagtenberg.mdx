linkedin_bio: "Julian Jagtenberg is the CEO and Co-Founder of Somnox, a category-carving company known for developing the first smart sleep companion proven to improve quality of rest. Julian brings a passion for robotics to his role at Somnox, where he and his team have built a science-backed sleep companion, shown to improve breathing and settle the mind for better sleep, recovery, and quality of life.\n\nCreated to help the sleep-deprived and start a global sleep revolution, Somnox was born from Julian‚Äôs desire to help his mother manage and overcome her insomnia. As an industrial design engineer, Julian developed this unique technology to empower everyday consumers to incorporate healthy routines and improve their holistic well-being. With more than 15,000 happy customers and multiple awards across design and engineering, including the James Dyson Award, Philips Innovation Award, Robotdalen Innovation Award and Sprout's 25 under 25, Julian is on a mission to help 100 million people worldwide achieve better sleep by 2030.  \n\n‚ÄúSleep is more than a pillar of good health, it is the foundation on which the bastions of exercise and diet are built. Compromising the bedrock of sleep lessens the efficacy of an otherwise healthy diet and lifestyle. Somnox aims to tackle the root-cause of sleep issues: feelings of stress and anxiety. The breathing guidance of Somnox helps people experience the profound power of breathwork and the benefits of quality sleep and overall calm. Sleep is a complex activity, so it's not surprising that external aids like the thousands of pillows and weighted blankets on the market haven't done much to reverse the growing sleep epidemic. We set out to create a safe, comfortable, and science-backed sleep aid that improves sleep through the power of breath and its impact on the autonomic nervous system. Somnox is proven to help people fall asleep faster by reducing feelings of stress and anxiety while also improving mood and energy levels the next day.‚Äù \n\nJulian graduated with honors from the Delft University of Technology with a degree in Industrial Design. He also holds a minor in Robotics from the Delft Biorobotics Lab ‚Äì 3mE (Faculty of Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering)."
