That was during my university years, and afterwards I combined it with other jobs. And, as time went by, my knowledge was growing, the same as the company.\\n\\nToday Sports Emotion -formerly known as Soloporteros- has became a reference in the ecommerce world, leading the South European market. A big business with more than 500 workers, 25 physical stores, and international ecommerce, franchises, selling in marketplaces, B2B, events and several stores (fútbol, basket)\\n\\nDuring this time, I have grown as the CTO with the company. Here I have worked both on the most operative and technical tasks to the most strategic and management oriented work. At the beginning, I was in charge of developing our website, and fixing everything that could broke in the IT systems. I developed our own ecommerce engine from the ground in 2010, using Zend Framework and Drupal, and this allowed us to start selling online in a solid basis. That website system was followed, two years later, by another internally developed solution whose basis I fully developed (MySQL Visual C#): our own ERP which gave support to every process in the company (orders, customer service, point of sale software...). From those bases the enterprise grew, as the IT staff did, and I have been in charge of coordinating every technological activity in the company: ecommerce, stores, omnichannel experience, event management, integrations, mobile APP, Business Intelligence... All of these things from an IT point of view, but always related to marketing online (SEO, social media, UX, analytics...) and to business.\\n\\nCurrently my challenge is to scale technology and our IT team keeping up with the breakneck speed of growth at Sports Emotion. I am also member of the Management Committee, and stockholder of the company.\"}]}]},{\"companyId\":\"15106496\",\"companyUrn\":\"urn:li:fsd company:15106496\",\"companyLink1\":\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/15106496/\",\"logo\":\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D0BAQEkQvRuxJ8AwA/company-logo 200 200/company-logo 200 200/0/1710847115269/esic logo e 1756339200&v beta&t gWUuDbpel-lWaX8A6fkPUxVLsru0XtS8zPZmCHc 7LE\",\"title\":\"Professor\",\"subtitle\":\"ESIC Business & Marketing School   Part-time\",\"caption\":\"Jan 2021 - Jul 2024   3 yrs 7 mos\",\"metadata\":\"Zaragoza, Aragon, Spain\",\"breakdown\":false,\"subComponents\":[{\"description\":[{\"type\":\"textComponent\",\"text\":\"Teacher of the following subjects in the Bachelor s degree in Marketing (ESIC Business & Marketing School / Universidad de San Jorge):\\n- Ecommerce (taught in Spanish)\\n- Social Media Marketing (taught in English)\"}]}]},{\"companyLink1\":\"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/ keywords Several companies\",\"title\":\"Karate Teacher\",\"subtitle\":\"Several companies\",\"caption\":\"Sep 2005 - Jul 2018   12 yrs 11 mos\",\"breakdown\":false,\"subComponents\":[{\"description\":[{\"type\":\"textComponent\",\"text\":\"Karate teacher in different organisations, developing this educational labour in parallel with my main jobs and studies:\\nColegio La Concepción - 2005-2007\\nCEIP Ana Mayayo - 2005-2006\\nCEIP Josefa Amar y Borbón - 2006-2009\\nCEIP Parque Goya I - 2006-2009\\nCEIP Montecanal - 2006-2009, 2015-2017\\nColegio Padre Enrique de Ossó - 2007-2009\\nEquipo Docente Sankukai - 2010-2022\\nCEIP Tomás Alvira - 2014-2015\"}]}]},{\"companyLink1\":\"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/ keywords Exitae 2C Escuela Universitaria de Formaci C3 B3n Abierta\",\"title\":\"Teacher at Curso Universitario Superior en Desarrollo de Proyectos de Internet\",\"subtitle\":\"Exitae, Escuela Universitaria de Formación Abierta\",\"caption\":\"Aug 2011 - Aug 2013   2 yrs 1 mo\",\"metadata\":\"Zaragoza, Aragon, Spain\",\"breakdown\":false,\"subComponents\":[{\"description\":[{\"type\":\"textComponent\",\"text\":\"Secondary job, complementing my main activity in Soloporteros.
