linkedin_bio: "I'm Managing Director at Zuko, basically responsible for spearheading our growth, making sure our product continues to wow customers and generally juggling 10 things at a time whilst trying to avoid everything falling off the rails (if I can mix my metaphors!).\n\nZuko is a form analytics software platform designed to get more customers completing your online forms and checkouts. It shows you where your users are struggling and dropping out so you can fix the issues and deliver a better customer experience.\n\nZuko has all the features and insight you need to be able to answer the following questions:\n- What fields cause my users to abandon?\n- What error messages are being shown, and how often?\n- What fields do users return to most?\n- What field takes most time to complete?\n- How do different devices interact with our form?\n- Can I be alerted when my form breaks?\n- What route do users take through our form?\n- Which step of our journey causes most abandonments?\n- What fields are the most problematic for our users?\n\nIf you're interested in finding out more.... drop me a message and ask me a question!\n\nAlun"
