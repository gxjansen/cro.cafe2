linkedin_bio: "30 years of entrepreneurship, innovation, and business leadership, and poised to make the world a better place. \n\nCurrently CEO of Radical Catalyst.\n\nI have been able to exit three successful technology-based startups to IBM, Limelight Networks and the other to a private equity group. I have equally grown dozens of early-stage companies across a wide variety of products and markets. I have helped hundreds of startups pull through the early venture, series A, and growth stages. \n\nAs a serial tech entrepreneur, I have had a long list of failures before becoming a 5x Founder with 3 exits, launching 3 venture funds, and a global product-market fit accelerator and school to train people to work in Silicon Valley Startups. I have a passion for commercilizing new technologies.\n\nWith these experiences, it is my greatest joy promoting employee engagement, diversity and future of work best practices. Sharing my knowledge in business with young entrepreneurs and helping them avoid the mistakes I made early on is so fulfilling. \n\nMY COMPETENCES\n\nLeadership\nInnovation\nCommercialization\nM&A\nFund Raising\n\nI am now committed to working with countries, companies, entrepreneurs on building sustainable plastics industries worldwide.\n\nDrop me a DM if I am someone youâ€™d like to collaborate with."
