linkedin_bio: "Consumer Psychologist w/ a passion for digital growth, data & experiments.\n=> Psychology Passionate\n=> Data Driven\n=> Evidence & Ethical everything\n\nTogether w/ the multidisciplinary teams within Online Dialogue I inspire, advice and assist companies in The Netherlands and across the globe with:\n√ becoming more data-driven and evidence-based\n√ learning & applying behavioural sciences\n√ improving their experimental skills (testing is NOT easy!)\n√ growing their Digital Revenue\n√ growing their Customer Intelligence\n\nI love assisting with and executing immense amounts of digital experiments (a/b-tests) with statistical powers, reliabilities and validities that most behavioural scientists can only dream of. This data-driven and evidence-everything approach delivers exponential growth, as well as an understanding of what truly drives and influences the behaviour of the human species.\n\nI believe we are currently executing \"the biggest psychological experiment\" ever. I assist companies in learning what drives our choices, emotions and behaviours better than we understand our selves or as science does. And whoops, that comes with serious ethical responsibilities, therefore I'm active in and initiating several task forces and associations on a national and European level)."
