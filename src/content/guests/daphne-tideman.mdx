linkedin_bio: "Growing a D2C startup is challenging; competition is rising, as are acquisition costs. \n\nYou need to stand out and focus on the actions that matter, but how? ü§î\n\nThat is where I come in. \n\nHi, I'm Daphne, a Dutchie living in London üëã .\n\nI‚Äôve worked on both the agency and brand side, meaning I‚Äôve seen it from both sides. In addition, I‚Äôve helped a wide range of business types and have experience as a Head of Growth for a start-up.\n\nI know what does and doesn't lead to growth.\n\nI decided to channel my experience into coaching Founders and the Head of Growths on how to grow faster. Even an hour or two a month can significantly impact results.\n\nSometimes you need someone to help you step back and see things from a 10,000-foot perspective. Sometimes you just need someone to reassure you that you‚Äôre on the right track. \nThat‚Äôs me; I‚Äôm your critical cheerleader, helping you move forward with open and honest advice.\n\nHere is why you should work with me:\n‚úÖ Grew the 1st startup I worked for from 1 to 25 employees and consulted 50+ brands.\n‚úÖ In 18 months as Head of Growths at Heights, I increased the subscriber base of Heights by 10x whilst keeping monthly churn under 8%. \n‚úÖ Wrote a book on Growing Happy Clients.\n‚úÖ Feature writer for GrowthHackers.com and BetterMarketing (11,000+ monthly readers).\n‚úÖ Work with over 20 brands monthly (both coaching and mentor sessions) so see a wide range of businesses, including well-known D2C startups like Ocean Bottle and Bower Collective.\n‚úÖ Spend 10+ hours a week learning, so always up-to-date with the latest trends.\n\nWho do I work with?\nüå±üèÉ Founders and Head of Growths of wellness and eco-friendly D2C Brands.\n\nWhat do you gain working with me?\nüöÄ Faster growth - I'll help you learn what to focus on and what not to get better results faster.\nüöÄ Expert advice - It can be expensive (and not always necessary) to hire a full-time Head of Growth. However, from just a few hours, you can get insights that will save you 100s of wasted hours for a fraction of the cost.\nüöÄ New knowledge - My goal is always to teach you how to solve a problem so that we can keep working on the next challenge.\n\nHow can we work together?\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Coaching - Monthly coaching to go through your growth challenges and develop a concrete action plan.\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Workshop - We can work together to re-energise your team from a short inspiration session to a deep dive hands-on workshop.\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Interim Head of Growth - 1 day per week (+2 hours of support) for brands who aren't ready (or still looking) for a full-time head of growth.\n\nJust drop me a message: hello@daphnetideman.com"
