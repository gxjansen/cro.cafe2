linkedin_bio: "** If you like my updates, posts and articles, please follow me! I reserve connection requests only for people I've met in real life or spent a fair amount of time with online working together on a project. ** \n\nPracticing psychology since 1999, I boost (behavioural) results of marketing- and communication activities by applying psychological techniques. Keynotes, seminars, workshops and consultancy. I put the theory and research into practice through behaviour change projects and interventions for clients (putting my money where my mouth is). Call me +31648109269 and I will make time for you.\n\n \"I believe in the power of perspectives ⌆. I change how people see things by applying evidence- and experience-based and theory-inspired psychological tactics.\"\n\n Primary focus is influence & persuasion, human behavior modification through persuasive communications and persuasive technology. I often use the Intervention Mapping framework, CASI, Fogg Behavior Model, COM-B / Behavior Change Wheel and the REDUCE framework. Secondary focus is the application of these principles and methods on the fields of social media marketing, organisational development, public health, information security (social engineering prevention strategies, security awareness) and Artificial Intelligende (AI).\n\n️ Love human behavior. How people (inter)act, feel & decide. Both online and offline. I believe organizations can benefit greatly from psychological insights in marketing, sales, education and more.\n\n️ Always available for an acquaintance, intake or short advice. I will make time for that.\nDue to limited availability, please include date or duration of project in public speaking & project requests. If possible I will reply the same day.\n️ mischa (at) greymatters (dot) nl\n +31648109269\n\nSpecialties: *** Psychology: behavior influence and change *** Media psychology *** Consumer psychology *** Behavioral strategy *** Persuasive communication *** Intervention Mapping *** Creative Strategy *** Contagion & Viral marketing *** Chief Psychology Officer *** Media strategy *** AI *** Online Marketing & Social Media ***"
