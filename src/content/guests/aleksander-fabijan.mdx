linkedin_bio: "I have extensive experience as a Data Scientist and Product Manager in building AI Platforms used for A/B testing and data analytics. On a day-to-day basis I leverage my product intuition and judgment to solve customer problems and make decisions without perfect information. In the past 8+ years, I have been managing and evolving the product portfolio and driving product vision and strategy in Azure AI Platform, specifically Experimentation Platform (ExP) and most recently Azure Open AI GPU data infrastructure. \n\nI am use mixed methos (both qualitative and quantitative techniques) to learn about customer problems, define success, and measure progress. I enjoy building data platforms, UX experiences, as well as creating API/SDK and event-driven interfaces. \n\nMy experience in engineering, data science, and product positions has thought me three important things about myself, the work that I do, and the people around me:\n(1) Clarity is essential for effective leadership, not just vision.\n(2) Perseverance generates energy, while left alone ambiguity and inaction drain it.\n(3) We are successful when we have clarity, perseverance, and others that enable us to be successful. \n\nI am interested in learning from different perspectives and meeting new people. If you want to collaborate on ICSE or KDD publications, please contact me. I would also like to connect with you if you are passionate about data-driven decision-making using A/B testing, AI system design, or API design, User Experience (UX), or large-scale experimentation."

The two core tenets of the platform are trustworthiness (an experiment is meaningful only if its results can be trusted) andscalability (we aspire to expose every single change in any product through an A/B experiment). \\nCurrently, over ten thousand experiments are run annually. In this paper, we describe the four core components of an A/B experimentation system: experimentation portal, experiment execution service, log processing service and analysis service, and explain the reasoning behind the design choices made. These four components work together to provide a system where ideas can turn into experiments within minutes and those experiments can provide initial trustworthy results within hours.\"}]}]},{\"title\":\"The evolution of continuous experimentation in software product development: from data to a data-driven organization at scale\",\"subtitle\":\"ICSE '17 Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Software Engineering · May 20, 2017\",\"breakdown\":false,\"subComponents\":[{\"description\":[{\"type\":\"textComponent\",\"text\":\"This publication provides guidance to software companies on the data-driven evolution path.
