linkedin_bio: "I'm passionate about data-driven decision making in the internet industry and beyond. Logic and empiric evidence is the way forward and I want to be paving the way as much as I can. To that end I've developed statistical tools for A/B testers at https://www.analytics-toolkit.com/ , wrote dozens of in-depth articles and white papers on the topics of web analytics, statistics, and online controlled experiments (A/B tests) as well as the book \"Statistical Methods in Online A/B Testing\". It also includes designing and presenting lectures for leading online education platforms such as the CXL Institute, starting the OneSided Project (https://www.onesided.org) and developing a huge repository of online computing resources at GIGAcalculator.com.\n\nIn between working on my own projects I consult clients on statistical and experimental methodology. I specialize in auditing experimentation programs to pinpoint issues and areas of improvement in methodology that lead to higher ROI tests and more trustworthy inferences. I am also an advisor to A/B Smartly, a fast-growing startup developing a sophisticated experimentation platform.\n\nBacking that up is more than a decade of experience with A/B testing, mostly focused on experimental design and statistical methodology. My prior experience is as an online marketing expert and analyst, SEO, Google AdWords, Web Analytics and statistical analysis specialist. For many years I've been a Google certified AdWords Expert, Google Analytics specialist, as well as a Google Certified Trainer for both. My experience also includes developing and operating dozens of websites. To this day I love to code in any language that makes life easier."
