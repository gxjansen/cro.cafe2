Services like Twitter can theoretically deliver messages to a huge audience that would be difficult to reach by other means. This article introduces a method to monitor an organization’s Twitter strategy and applies it to tweets from United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) accounts. The Resonating Topic Method uses automatic analyses with free software to detect successful themes within the organization’s tweets, categorizes the most successful tweets, and analyses a comparable organization to identify new successful strategies. In the case of UNDP tweets from November 2014 to March 2015, the results confirm the importance of official social media accounts as well as those of high profile individuals and general supporters. Official accounts seem to be more successful at encouraging action, which is a critical aspect of social media campaigning. An analysis of Oxfam found a successful social media approach that the UNDP had not adopted, showing the value of analyzing other organizations to find potential strategy gaps.\"}]}]},{\"title\":\"Persuasive backfiring: When behavior change interventions trigger unintended negative outcomes\",\"subtitle\":\"International Conference on Persuasive Technology · Apr 5, 2016\",\"breakdown\":false,\"subComponents\":[{\"description\":[{\"type\":\"textComponent\",\"text\":\"Numerous scholars study how to design evidence-based interventions that can improve the lives of individuals, in a way that also brings social benefits. \\n\\nHowever, within the behavioral sciences in general, and the persuasive technology field specifically, scholars rarely focus-on, or report the negative outcomes of behavior change interventions, and possibly fewer report a special type of negative outcome, a backfire. \\n\\nThis paper has been authored to start a wider discussion within the scientific community on intervention backfiring. \\n\\nWithin this paper, we provide tools to aid academics in the study of persuasive backfiring, present a taxonomy of backfiring causes, and provide an analytical framework containing the intention-outcome and likelihood-severity matrices.\\n\\nTo increase knowledge on how to mitigate the negative impact of intervention backfiring, we discuss research and practitioner implications.\"}]}]}]"
