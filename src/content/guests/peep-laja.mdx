linkedin_bio: "Most of your future revenues are gonna come from future customers. \n\nIf you knew *exactly* what your target customers\n\nthink about your category (and your company in particular),\nwhat their top priorities and very big problems are,\nwhat unsaturated channels they use to learn about solutions, \n\nthis is what'd happen to your business:\n\n- you'd nail your messaging, speaking exactly to their pain points\n- your conversion rates would go up because your pitch resonates better,\n- your CAC would go down as you'd use the right channels with the right message,\n- you'd create more meaningful content that moves the dial,\n- you'd be more deliberate and accurate in providing more value at every touch point,\n- you'd know how to price your products to maximize willingness to pay,\n- you'd know how to differentiate,\n- you'd know where your go-to-market strategy is off, and could fix it. \n \nThe beautiful thing?\n\nYou can know all of this with Wynter in under 48 hours."
