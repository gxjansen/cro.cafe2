linkedin_bio: "I would describe myself as a creative marketer with an interest and experience in broad areas. Not only because I studied Communication & Multimedia Design but moreover because of my (work)experience. The last couple of years I learned a lot about (content) marketing, conversation design, growth hacking and more. I worked in different roles at small and big companies.\n\nThe common thread: in everything I do, my focus is on the customer. Always. That might seem logical, but it turns out to be a challenge for many organizations. Iâ€™d be happy to help you with that challenge. Do you think we could be of value to each other? Get in touch for a (virtual) coffee."
