linkedin_bio: "Hello, and thanks for visiting my profile! My name is Polle de Maagt and I am an independent (business/digital/brand) strategy consultant working all around Europe. I try to change companies to be more about acts and less about ads. Because I believe companies have a lot of unused potential. Because I believe that the most successful companies connect with their consumers. And because I believe it isnâ€™t about remarkable talks, but about remarkable acts.\n\nAfter working for Belgian trendwatching agency Trendwolves, I joined Dutch/Belgian advertising agency Boondoggle to work on clients like Rabobank, Nike and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. After that, I joined InSites Consulting, a pretty remarkable research agency. Not to do research, but to change companies to be more consumer connected, based on extensive research and tested models and frameworks.\n\nAnd now, I work as an independent consultant, with a range of agencies and clients to make the world more consumer connected.\n\nSpecialties: Business insights, business strategy, branding, behavioral design, customer experience, digital technology, remarkableness, epicness."
