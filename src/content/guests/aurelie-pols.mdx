Add increased processing power, keep an eye on what's legally acceptable to remain ethical.\n\nAurélie pioneered Digital analytics in Europe as one of the first Google Analytics consultancies in Europe. She co-founded OX2 in Belgium in 2003, which was successfully sold to UK based Digitas LBi (Publicis) in 2008 with an EBIT of 20%.\nAurélie works as an independent consultant, defining data flows and supporting companies in their risk exercises to determine potential data liabilities. \n\nShe focuses on delivering value to the bottom line while keeping an eye on European legislation, pushing a Privacy by Design agenda. This includes the ePrivacy Directive, the GDPR, the DMA and the upcoming AI Act in Europe which she uses as a base line for gap analysis with emerging laws such as US state legislations and the other “privacy laws” influenced by the Brussels ripple effect caused by the GDPR. \nHer main focus, besides coaching analysts & data officers, are data flows, risk mitigating measures and documentation; digital & analytics teams with their HR responsibility set-up & a respect for fundamental rights as our societies continue to digitalize."
