linkedin_bio: "I'm the bestselling author of Never Split the Difference, former lead international FBI kidnapping negotiator, and CEO and founder of The Black Swan Group. During my 24-year career with the FBI, I served as the FBI's hostage negotiation representative for the National Security Council’s Hostage Working Group, and have represented the U.S. at two international conferences. I was recognized for a number of awards, including the Attorney General’s Award, and the FBI Agents Association Award for Distinguished and Exemplary Service. I've received negotiation training from the FBI, Scotland Yard, and Harvard Law School. \n\nSince retiring from the FBI, I've earned my Master’s in Public Administration from Harvard University, and taught at a number of esteemed institutions, including the University of Southern California Marshall School of Business, Georgetown University, Harvard University, Northwestern University, the IMD Business School in Lausanne, Switzerland, and the Goethe Business School in Frankfurt, Germany. \n\nFollowing Never Split the Difference, I co-authored a book with real estate guru, Steve Shull, The Full Fee Agent, which provides practical and skillful negotiation techniques for real estate agents—both experienced and expert. My company and myself have been featured on podcasts and media outlets such as TIME magazine, CNN, CNBC, the Lex Fridman podcast, Inc., and others. My company, The Black Swan Group, established in 2008, aims at providing negotiation coaching for Fortune 500 companies and professionals all over the world through corporate and individual coaching, as well as live events. \n\nTo connect with myself or my company, you can go to blackswanltd.com, and also follow me here on LinkedIn or on Instagram.
