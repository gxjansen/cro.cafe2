linkedin_bio: "I help businesses scale by designing the systems behind growth.\nRooted in UX design thinking, I approach business development as a cross-functional discipline â€” where customer experience, internal workflows, and team execution must align.\n\nMy work lives at the intersection of:\nâ€¢ Product, Marketing, and Sales\nâ€¢ Operations, Logistics, and Finance\n\nI specialize in:\nâ€¢ Identifying bottlenecks and mapping root causes\nâ€¢ Translating complexity into scalable, clear, and executable solutions\n\nFrom redesigning buying platforms to automating marketing-to-sales flows, I lead projects that combine systems thinking, workflow design, and cross-team alignment.\n\nCurrently, as a shareholder and member of the management team, I combine long-term vision with hands-on leadership â€” building systems that serve both the business and the people behind it.\nI serve as Chief Business Development at a fast-scaling platform, operating as a business designer focused on internal processes, automation, and strategic clarity.\n\nPreviously, Iâ€™ve held CPO-level responsibilities, with roots in persuasion design and digital product development."
