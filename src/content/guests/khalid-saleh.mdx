linkedin_bio: "Because improving conversion rates should NOT feel like a gamble, our model is simple: No results, No payment.\n\nHi, I'm Khalid Saleh, co-founder & CEO of Invesp. \n\nWe're The World's #1 ranked Conversion Rate Optimization Agency, helping brands increase conversions by 35% in 180 days or less. \n\nHow do we help brands generate more pipeline, revenue, and profits?\n\nWe fix the low-hanging fruit on their sites, create a strategic conversion roadmap, and move fast. \n\nWe improve conversions for just about every business type—SaaS, ecommerce, traditional retail, lead gen—you name it. Our clients include big names like eBay, Target, Discover, BarkBox, and startups you'll soon be talking about.\n\nMy story? \n\nI am a recovering software architect. \n\nIn 2005, I was the proud architect of a $50 million ecommerce site that... well, let's just say it didn't go as planned.\n\nTons of visitors, but only 10 orders.\n\nTwo things happened as a result: \n1. I missed my annual bonus \n2. I wondered if there is something brands can do to turn visitors into customers\n\nSo, in 2006, I co-founded Invesp, one of the first agencies focused entirely on conversion rate optimization (CRO) & AB testing.\n\nSince then, we've run over 36,000 A/B tests and helped hundreds of companies increase online sales.\nWhen you have that many A/B tests under your belt, you can do things others can't. \n\nWe've built a Conversion Intelligence Platform that uses machine learning to supercharge any CRO program we run. Companies we work with see an average of 12x return on their investment with us.\n\nHere is what you get with Invesp:\n- Conversion Rate Optimization: Platform + Professional services team.\n- Conversion Rate Audit: Identifying your website's biggest conversion blockers. \n- Landing Page Optimization: Creating pages that convert.\n- CRO Training: Empowering your team with CRO skills\n\nWhat I do:\n- Lead CRO projects.\n- Speak at top marketing conferences worldwide (SMX, PubCon, Shop.org, Internet Retailer).\n- Write about CRO, marketing strategies, and business growth.\n\nMy approach?\nNo trendy \"growth hacks.\"\n\nI believe in solid data, careful analysis, and strategies that actually work for your business.\n\nWant to learn more?\n- Check out my blog: https://www.invespcro.com/blog\n- Read my book on Amazon: https://www.invespcro.com/cro-book\n- Connect with me here on LinkedIn for regular tips on CRO and e-commerce growth\n\nLet's talk about how we can boost your online sales."

For larger clients, these tools were expensive. \\n\\nBut it does not stop there. These tools were slowing down our client sites. We seemed to be fighting with IT teams to convince them to keep these tools in place. CTOs complained that we are causing performance issues. \\n\\nThese tools tracked visitors in different ways. So, an AB testing tool told our clients that they get 500k visitors/month. The heatmap tool told them they only 350k visitors/month. And not to be outdone, session replay tool them told them they get 600k visitors/month. You get the idea. \\n\\nFrustrated with all this, we decided to build an internal tool that our clients can use. A year later FigPii was born. We started using it with our existing clients.\\n\\nImmediately, things got better. The cost is down. No more complaints about site slowing down because of all the different scripts. We can add also useful features that can help us understand visitors better. \\n\\nMany clients suggested that we release the tool publicly. Although the idea is attractive. But we knew that a bigger spotlight will be shined on the tool if we do so. There is a big difference between a tool that you use internally and a tool that is available to the public. \\n\\nBut we kept hearing the same feedback - release it, people will love it. \\n\\nIn January of 2020, we made the tool available to the public for the first time. Within the first month, we had about 400 companies sign up for an account and start using the tool. \\n\\nOur consulting projects have driven the features that you see in FigPii. Now, we are getting constant feedback and suggestions of things to add. We love that.\"}]}]},{\"companyId\":\"51771\",\"companyUrn\":\"urn:li:fsd company:51771\",\"companyLink1\":\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/51771/\",\"logo\":\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQE1ZQiHTvlaqQ/company-logo 200 200/company-logo 200 200/0/1630626973435/edl logo e 1756339200&v beta&t fvAz55rzuA4tbnBwkKS1wGyuQrX5mCKQOe7j0Yk7z-E\",\"title\":\"Managing Consultant\",\"subtitle\":\"EDL   Full-time\",\"caption\":\"2006 - 2009   3 yrs\",\"metadata\":\"Chicago, Illinois, United States\",\"breakdown\":false,\"subComponents\":[{\"description\":[{\"type\":\"textComponent\",\"text\":\"My previous life  I worked as a software architect serving Fortune 1000 companies helping them build the latest and greatest commerce sites.
