linkedin_bio: "I am a technical advisor to startups and other organizations, particularly in responsible AI.\n\nI was Director of Research at the Institute for Experiential AI of Northeastern University from 2021 to 2025. \n\nFrom 2016 to 2020 I was CTO of NTENT, a semantic search technology company located in California as well as CEO of NTENT Hispania, a R+D filial in Barcelona, Spain, since 2017.\n\nUntil 2016 I was VP of Research at Yahoo Labs, first in Barcelona, Spain, and then in Sunnyvale, California, where I technically lead projects in web search and mining, web advertising, and data science in general. As a manager I also oversaw the Haifa lab for 5 years and started the London lab in 2012. I was also in the board of Yahoo Israel and Hungary.\n\nBefore I was an ICREA research professor at the Dept. of Information and Communication Technologies of Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, Spain, and Professor and founding director of the Center for Web Research at the Dept. of Computing Science of Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile. I am still part-time professor at both departments.\n\nI am co-author of the best-seller Modern Information Retrieval textbook, published in 1999 by Addison-Wesley with a second enlarged edition in 2011, which won the ASIST 2012 Book of the Year award. I am also co-author of the 2nd edition of the Handbook of Algorithms and Data Structures, Addison-Wesley, 1991; and co-editor of Information Retrieval: Algorithms and Data Structures, Prentice-Hall, 1992, among more than 500 other publications. \n\nI have received the Organization of American States award for young researchers in exact sciences (1993), the Graham Medal for innovation in computing given by the University of Waterloo to distinguished ex-alumni (2007), the CLEI Latin American distinction for contributions to CS in the region (2009), the National Award of the Chilean Association of Engineers (2010), a Spanish Research Award in CS (2018) and a Chilean Applied Science Award (2024), among other distinctions. Since 2010 I am a founding member of the Chilean Academy of Engineering. \n\nIn 2009 I was named ACM Fellow and in 2011 IEEE Fellow."

Using complex network analysis and engagement metrics, we characterise the networks, which we define at several time-based granularity levels: hourly, daily, weekly and monthly. Studying and comparing networks at such different granularities allow us to identify long-term and sudden variations in traffic between sites, including non-lasting fluctuations. Our objective is to identify whether temporal variations in the user traffic affect user engagement with the sites in the network. The networks are built from interaction data extracted from one year of browsing activity of 2.5M users across 770 sites encompassing diverse types of services such as social media, news and mail.\"}]}]}]"
