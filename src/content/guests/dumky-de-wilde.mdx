This dissertation investigates the use of those concepts in the political arena after 9/11, starting from the question how fear influences freedom. It looks into different concepts of freedom —negative and positive as well as imaginary and procedural— and how they are used as a political justification, it then looks at how to understand fear and its influence on freedom, considering human biases and collective irrationality taking into account a positive psychologised idea of freedom. Finally, the so- called ‘war on terror’ after 9/11 questions the politics of the intertwined concepts of freedom, fear and security. Throughout we’ll see how different policies question the balance of freedom and security as we try to understand their political justification in terms of freedom, and that has changed since 9/11.\"}]}]}]"
