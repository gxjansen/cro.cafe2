linkedin_bio: "As a hands-on Martech practitioner, I help mid-sized and enterprise companies make sense of complex stacks and turn them into something that actually works.\n\nWith 20+ years across digital analytics, server-side tagging, CDPs, CEPs, and the occasional CMP headache, Iâ€™ve seen how ambition and reality often diverge. My work spans the full lifecycle: from early-stage assessments and vendor evaluations to implementation, orchestration, and team coaching. Iâ€™m often called in to fix what others left unfinished or to guide teams through whatâ€™s never been done before.\n\nAlongside the delivery work, I host the podcast Couch Confidentials and write on Substack, sharing lessons from the field, reflections on emerging practices like Agentic AI, and the quiet reality of making Martech work under pressure.\n\nI donâ€™t chase that shiny object. I focus on durable solutions, good questions, and helping teams build systems they can trust."
