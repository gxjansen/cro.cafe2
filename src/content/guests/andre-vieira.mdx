linkedin_bio: "Hello there!\n\nI’m a customer journey optimization expert who spent a considerable amount of time over the past 10 years exploring the intersection between analytics and human behavior in digital platforms with one goal: understanding what makes people tick when they navigate interfaces.\n\nThis gave me the opportunity to help more than 100 companies across the globe improve the value they generate with their customer journeys and marketing initiatives – not only from a perspective of profitability, but also considering broader scopes such as customer satisfaction, brand equity, efficiency of selling strategies, amongst other often ignored facets of optimization.\n\nDuring this process I’ve come to realize that my value to companies and people alike can be fairly well summarized by the following three points:\n\n• I’ve lived and breathed digital my whole life. I have extensive experience with customer journey optimization in digital platforms, having worked in all sorts of digital projects for diverse agencies and companies.\n\n• I am a nonconformist. In my modest opinion, things should work properly, always. I do not settle for suboptimal results.\n\n• I genuinely love to learn and to teach. I believe that collaboration is a unique key to unlock powerful outcomes. This makes me go more than the extra mile to make sure that everyone (including myself) and everything around me is constantly evolving.\n\nI split my year between São Paulo (Brazil) and Hamburg (Germany). I'm also always happy to connect and have a good talk about topics related to experimentation and customer journey optimization! :)\n\nSpecialties: Customer Journey Optimization, Conversion Rate Optimization, Customer Journey Analysis, User Experience Research, Digital Analytics, Competitive Intelligence, Business Management, Advertising, Performance Marketing, Mobile Marketing, Data Visualization, Storytelling and Team Development."
