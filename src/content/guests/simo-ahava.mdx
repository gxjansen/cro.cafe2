Please do not ask me for free consultation / help with something that’s “probably super quick for me to solve”.\n\nIf I don’t answer your messages, it’s only because I think LinkedIn is a silly platform and I try to spend as little time here as possible. Yes, I’m using it wrong; no, I don’t need you to tell me how to use it correctly, but thank you :-) \n\nIf you want to learn about me, visit simoahava.com or teamsimmer.com!"

Transcribing rural speech and compiling it into a fully functional archive or corpus is riddled with problems and pitfalls that must be acknowledged during corpus compilation (see e.g. Beal et al. 2007). In this paper, I will comment on the problem of content description, previously visited in my unpublished Master's Thesis (Ahava 2010a). The question is whether or not transcriptions combined with a versatile enough annotation schema (XML with TEI specifications in the case of HARES) can solve the paradoxical problem of using text to describe speech. This problem is persistent especially when grammaticality of the transcribed utterance is under scrutiny. Thus I will also introduce an intermediate variant in the past BE paradigm of Cambridgeshire dialect speakers (Ahava 2010a, see also Richards 2010) and illustrate how it characterises the problem of content description, which people doing transcription work and spoken language corpus compilation must resolve.\"}]}]}]"
