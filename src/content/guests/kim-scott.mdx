They guide a team to achieve results. Relationship at work are core to a manager's job. Relationships determine whether they can fulfill their three responsibilities: 1) to create a culture of guidance (praise and criticism) that will keep everyone moving in the right direction; 2) to understand what motivates each person on the team well enough to avoid burn-out or boredom and keep the team cohesive; and 3) to drive results collaboratively. \\n\\nIf you think it's possible to do these things without strong relationships, you are kidding yourself. I’m not saying that unchecked power, control, or authority can’t work. They work especially well in a baboon troop or a totalitarian regime. But if you’re reading this book, that’s not what you’re shooting for. \\n\\nThere is a virtuous cycle between a boss's responsibilities and their relationships. They strengthen these relationships by learning the best ways to get, give, and encourage guidance; by putting the right people in the right roles on your team; and by achieving results collectively that one couldn’t dream of individually. Of course, there can be a vicious cycle between these responsibilities and relationships, too. When bosses fail to give people the guidance they need to succeed in their work, or put people into roles on the team they don’t want or aren’t well-suited for, or push people to achieve results they feel are unrealistic, they erode trust.\\n\\nYour relationships and your responsibilities reinforce each other positively or negatively, and this dynamic is what drives you forward as a manager—or leaves you dead in the water. \\n\\nDefining those relationships is vital. They’re deeply personal, and they’re not like any other relationships in your life. But most of us are at a loss when we set about to build those relationships. Radical Candor, the fundamental concept of this book, can help guide you.\\n\"},{\"type\":\"mediaComponent\",\"text\":\"Radical Candor: Be a Kick-Ass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity\",\"thumbnail\":\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/sync/v2/D4E27AQGaXH6m4ZrLzA/articleshare-shrink_800/articleshare-shrink_800/0/1712145517955?e=1751292000&v=beta&t=_akLyfdV7DuG27yWToBGa-ySqYFdWfrUtNhxLPibLuQ\"}]},{\"title\":\"Co-Founder\",\"caption\":\"Jan 2017 - Present · 8 yrs 6 mos\",\"metadata\":\"Los Altos, CA\",\"description\":[{\"type\":\"textComponent\",\"text\":\"We help companies create healthy feedback cultures, build cohesive teams, and achieve results collaboratively.\"},{\"type\":\"mediaComponent\",\"text\":\"A Better Way to Work\",\"thumbnail\":\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D562DAQFHcnK-GtCcsA/profile-treasury-image-shrink_800_800/profile-treasury-image-shrink_800_800/0/1684444308895?e=1751292000&v=beta&t=UT1WxpfIXX78qaEi3jcVz_Oqgifww-cukc0PcPxCYW0\"}]}]},{\"companyLink1\":\"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Candor%2C+Inc\",\"title\":\"CEO and co-founder\",\"subtitle\":\"Candor, Inc\",\"caption\":\"Jan 2016 - May 2017 · 1 yr 5 mos\",\"metadata\":\"Silicon Valley, CA\",\"breakdown\":false,\"subComponents\":[{\"description\":[{\"type\":\"textComponent\",\"text\":\"We built an app to help managers remember to solicit feedback, and to give praise and crticism.
