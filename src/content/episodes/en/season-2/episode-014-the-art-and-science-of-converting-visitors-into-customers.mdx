  Khalid Saleh is CEO at Invesp, one of the first companies in North America dedicated to CRO that he founded back in 2006. He's also the co-author of an Amazon.com's bestselling book: "Conversion Optimization: The Art and Science of Converting Visitors into Customers, a book he published already 10 years ago.
  Khalid brings a ton of experience to the table and Iâ€™m glad to be talking to him today about the seemingly simple task of finding the things that are broken on your website.
