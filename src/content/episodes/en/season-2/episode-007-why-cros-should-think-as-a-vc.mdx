  Sean is a serial entrepreneur, venture capitalist and co-founder of GrowthX and the GrowthX Academy. He has successfully grown dozens of early-stage companies across a wide variety of products and markets. He’s now committed to working on building startup ecosystems and developing the next generation of leaders for the innovation economy.
  
  Sean and I discuss some Strategies for Navigating Through Tough Times and talk about how CROs like you and me can deal with companies asking us to optimize when there isn’t even a product/market fit.
