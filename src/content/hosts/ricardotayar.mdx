Ricardo Tayar López is the entrepreneurial force behind Flat 101, a CRO and digital experience agency he founded in 2013. As CEO, he’s guided over 300 digital projects, authored Spain’s first CRO book in Spanish, and launched an acclaimed CRO study now in its fourth edition, proof he’s steeped in both theory and practice of conversion optimization.

A UX and SEO veteran, Ricardo brings a bilingual flair (English & Spanish) and an infectious enthusiasm for turning data into delightful user experiences. On [CRO.CAFE](http://CRO.CAFE) he peppers technical insights with cultural references (“just like a good tapas bar, CRO is all about the right mix!”), making each episode a flavor-packed journey. 🍷📈
