# NocoDB Synchronization Test Results - All Tables

## Executive Summary
- **Test Date**: 2025-06-18
- **Tables Tested**: Episodes, Guests, Hosts, Platforms
- **Overall Result**: PARTIAL SUCCESS with issues

## Detailed Test Results by Table

### üì∫ Episodes Table
- **Creation**: ‚úÖ SUCCESS - File created with correct data
- **Update**: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL - Only timestamps updated, not content
- **Deletion**: ‚ùå FAILED - File not removed after record deletion

### üë• Guests Table  
- **Creation**: ‚úÖ SUCCESS - File created at `src/content/guests/test-guest-qa.mdx`
- **Update**: Not tested yet
- **Deletion**: Not tested yet
- **Notes**: AI bio was used instead of regular bio field

### üéôÔ∏è Hosts Table
- **Creation**: ‚úÖ SUCCESS - File created at `src/content/hosts/test-host-qa.mdx`
- **Update**: Not tested yet
- **Deletion**: Not tested yet
- **Notes**: Social links were empty array despite data being provided

### üéµ Platforms Table
- **Creation**: ‚ùå FAILED - File created but with wrong data
- **File Name**: Created as `platform-24.json` instead of `test-platform-qa.json`
- **Content**: Generic placeholder data instead of test data
- **Issue**: Platform sync appears to use different logic/mapping

## Key Findings

### 1. Synchronization Issues
- **Updates don't fully sync**: Only metadata (timestamps) update, not actual content
- **Deletions not handled**: No mechanism to remove files when records are deleted
- **Platform mapping broken**: Test data not properly transferred for platforms

### 2. Field Mapping Inconsistencies
- Episodes: Field names must be lowercase (title not Title)
- Guests: Uses ai_bio field preferentially over bio
- Hosts: Social links not properly mapped from individual fields
- Platforms: Complete mismatch between input and output

### 3. Workflow Limitations
- No validation before file creation
- No error reporting for failed mappings
- Overwrites existing files without proper update logic

## Recommendations for Fixes

### High Priority
1. **Implement deletion sync**: Add logic to detect and remove files for deleted records
2. **Fix update mechanism**: Ensure content changes propagate, not just timestamps
3. **Fix platform synchronization**: Correct field mapping for platforms table

### Medium Priority
1. **Add data validation**: Validate required fields before creating files
2. **Improve error handling**: Log and report field mapping failures
3. **Standardize field names**: Use consistent naming across all tables

### Low Priority
1. **Add test mode**: Safe testing without affecting production data
2. **Create sync reports**: Detailed logs of what was synced/skipped
3. **Add rollback capability**: Ability to undo sync operations

## Test Data Created
- **Episodes**: ID 1991 (deleted)
- **Guests**: ID 640 (still exists)
- **Hosts**: ID 6 (still exists)
- **Platforms**: ID 24 (still exists)

## Next Steps
1. Clean up remaining test data
2. Fix identified issues in sync workflow
3. Re-run tests after fixes
4. Document proper field mappings for each table
