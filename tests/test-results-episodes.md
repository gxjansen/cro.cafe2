# Episode Table Test Results

## Test Summary
- **Table**: Episodes
- **Test Date**: 2025-06-18
- **Tester**: Automated QA Testing

## Test Results

### ✅ Test A: File Creation
1. **Created test record in NocoDB**: SUCCESS
   - Record ID: 1991
   - Title: "TEST Episode 999 - Automated Testing"
   - Slug: "test-episode-999-automated-testing"
   
2. **Triggered GitHub Action**: SUCCESS
   - Workflow run completed successfully
   
3. **File created in GitHub**: SUCCESS
   - Path: `src/content/episodes/en/season-99/episode-999-test-episode-999-automated-testing.mdx`
   
4. **Content validation**: SUCCESS
   - Title, description, and all fields correctly transferred
   - Duration converted from seconds (1800) to string format in file

### ⚠️ Test B: File Update
5. **Updated test record in NocoDB**: SUCCESS
   - Changed title, description, and duration
   
6. **Triggered GitHub Action**: SUCCESS
   - Workflow run completed successfully
   
7. **File update validation**: PARTIAL SUCCESS
   - UpdatedAt timestamp changed (confirming sync occurred)
   - However, title and description changes were not reflected
   - This suggests the sync overwrites with original data rather than updates

### ❌ Test C: File Deletion
8. **Deleted test record from NocoDB**: SUCCESS
   - Record successfully removed from database
   
9. **Triggered GitHub Action**: SUCCESS
   - Workflow run completed successfully
   
10. **File deletion validation**: FAILED
    - File still exists in repository after sync
    - Current sync workflow does not handle deletions

## Issues Found

1. **Update Synchronization**: Updates to existing records don't fully propagate - only timestamps update
2. **Deletion Not Implemented**: The sync workflow doesn't remove files when records are deleted from NocoDB
3. **Field Name Mismatch**: Initial attempt failed due to field name differences (e.g., `Title` vs `title`)

## Recommendations

1. **Implement deletion logic** in the sync workflow to remove files for deleted records
2. **Fix update logic** to properly sync changed field values, not just timestamps
3. **Add validation** for required fields before creating files
4. **Consider adding** a test mode to the workflow for safer testing
